This is a series of blog posts that I will be making at the start of each month, as a monthly roadmap for what to focus each month.

<h2 class=" text-xl">Projects</h2>
- Litehouse: This is a small project that I've been working for tracking web vitals with Lighthouse or PageSpeed. 
    - <span class="text-accent ml-4">Objective: </span>Achieve a stable version. 

- Clilor: A simple CLi made in Go to convert colors formats.

- Web replication: The idea here is to replicate websites pages that I like to improve my skills. In this month I have in mind the [SST](https://sst.dev/) land page.
